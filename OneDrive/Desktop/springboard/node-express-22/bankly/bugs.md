1. missing .env file
2. get all user routes already have authUser so there's no need for requirelogin
3. In the DELETE route,  we're calling User.delete(req.params.username) but youâ€™re not awaiting the result. This could result in the response being sent before the deletion is actually completed.
4. In the PATCH /[username] route, we're deleting the _token field from the request body, but this field is never actually part of the req.body
